# FamousActors
Famous Actors Data Science Project

## **Objective:**

Github Project Famous Actors

Analyze facial features, similarities, and differences among popular actors and potentially classify them.

### **2. Steps to Implement the Project:**

### **a. Data Preprocessing:**

- **Resize Images:** Ensure all images are of the same size.
- **Normalization:** Normalize pixel values to the range [0,1].

### **b. Feature Extraction:**

- Use pre-trained models like **`VGG16`**, **`ResNet`**, or **`MobileNet`** from **`Keras`** applications to extract features from the images.

### **c. Data Exploration & Analysis:**

- Use **`Principal Component Analysis (PCA)`** or **`t-SNE`** for dimensionality reduction to visualize clusters of similar faces or features.
- Analyze the distribution of facial features, identifying common traits among the celebrities in your dataset.

### **d. Model Training:**

- If labels for each actor exist, we'd train a classification model.
- If not, use unsupervised learning techniques, such as clustering, to group similar faces.

### **e. Model Evaluation:**

- For the supervised approach, evaluate the model using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 Score, etc.
- For unsupervised learning, silhouette score, Davies–Bouldin index, etc., can be used to assess the quality of clustering.

### **f. Insights and Visualization:**

- Visualize the clustering of actors in 2D space.
- Identify the most distinctive and common facial features among the actors.

### **3. Tools & Libraries:**

- **Image Processing:** **`OpenCV`**
- **Data Manipulation:** **`numpy`**, **`pandas`**
- **Machine Learning:** **`scikit-learn`**, **`Keras`**, **`TensorFlow`**
- **Data Visualization:** **`matplotlib`**, **`seaborn`**, **`Plotly`**

### **4. Going Beyond:**

- Perform facial sentiment analysis to infer emotions from actor’s images.
- Use facial landmarks to analyze and compare facial structures.
- Create a face recognition system that can identify the actors in new, unseen images.
- Develop an interface where users can upload an image and identify whether the person in the image resembles any actor in the dataset.

### **5. Documentation & Presentation:**

- Share the project on GitHub and a detailed README file to guide the viewers through the project.
